## Questions 

**You do not need to write in complete sentences _except_ for one of your answers in Set 2 (see instructions).**

### Set 1 

**Instructions: For these questions, simply list the variables.**

1. Which variable(s), if any, in this dataset is/are *categorical*?

2. Which variable(s), if any, in this dataset is/are *numeric continuous*?

3. Which variable(s), if any, in this dataset is/are *numeric discrete*?

4. For which variable(s), if any, are *all values KNOWN* (in other words, there is no missing data)?

### Set 2

**Instructions: For these questions, indicate if the presented information is a _variable_ or a _value_ in the dataset.** If it is a variable, provide one of the values associated with the variable (don't make it up - find a value in the data!). If it is a value, tell me what variable the value belongs to. If part of your answer is _ambiguous_ (Hint: one and only one question below is partially ambiguous), explain in 1 sentence why you can't reliably answer the full question.

**Hint: Use the search bar above the table to help you!**

1. `species`

2. `kona`

3. `8`

4. `balance`

5. `region`

6. `moisture`

7. `Bourbon`

8. `79.08`


### Set 3

**Instructions: For these questions, simply answer whether the choice of data visualization is appropriate or not with "yes" or "no".** Your answers should be based ONLY on whether the type of plot is technically appropriate for visualizing those data types (don't worry about whether it might "look pretty" or not).

1. You make a *scatterplot* to visualize the distribution of `aroma` coffee gradings.

2. You make a *barplot* to visualize how many coffees come from each country in the dataset.

3. You make a *histogram* to visualize the distribution of `total_cup_points`.

4. You make a *violin plot* to visualize the distribution of `balance` for each species of coffee.

5. You make a *scatterplot* to visualize the relationship between coffee flavor and sweetness grades.

6. You make a *boxplot* to visualize how many coffees of each species there are. 

7. You make a *density plot* to visualize the relationship between the number of bags produced and the number of defects found for each coffee.

8. You make a *strip plot* to visualize the distribution of `balance` coffee gradings.

9. You make a *barplot* to visualize the distribution of `acidity` coffee gradings.
