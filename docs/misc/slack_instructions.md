## What is Slack?

Slack is an app available for both Desktop and mobile (or, access via browser) that let's your work teams communicate. 

We will use Slack this semester as our "discussion board," and as a convenient place to ask each other questions and help your fellow classmates out. You can either send direct messages (DM's) or post in slacks `#channels` to communicate. You can enter different channels from the left side bars. Channels loosely organized so that posts can be associated with specific topics. Our channels are:

+ `#general`: For all kinds of general questions about coding, R, and RStudio
+ `#logistics`: For questions about deadlines, instructions, or class technologies (Canvas, Zoom)
+ `#introductions`: The channel where everyone should make at least one post introducing themselves. 
+ `#random`: The channel for sharing fun things that don't need to have anything to do with class. Find a fun meme? Share it! Have a good picture? Share it! *Please keep is SFW.*
+ `#tidy-tuesday`: A channel for sharing your tidy tuesdays and/or asking question about tidy tuesday. *This channel will not be relevant until late February - stay tuned!*


### Getting help in Slack

+ My Slack hours are the same as my email hours. Specifically, my notifications will be turned OFF in the Slack outside my email hours. I may still check in now and again, but do not rely on asking me questions in the evenings/weekends.

+ When posting questions in Slack, please tag me with `@Dr. Spielman` (it will autocomplete if you type "Spielman") if you want to make extra sure *I personally* see the post. I will regularly check into the Slack either way, but tagging me will notify me.

+ Some previous "Data Science for Biologists" students (currently junior and senior Biology majors at Rowan) have *super generously volunteered* to float in and out of the Slack and help answer your coding questions. These students are not formal TAs or tutors - they are doing this since they loved the data science class and want to help others learn! You will meet them as the semester goes by in the Slack, and you can identify them because their names will end in "TA." 

+ **Please remember that all the academic integrity rules still apply!!** You should never send each other your homework scripts or full answers to a homework question. Of course, in many circumstances, you will want to share your code with others to get some help fixing bugs, for example. Sharing a snippet of your code with your fellow students *is completely fine and encouraged*, if it's for the purposes of asking for help on your code. By contrast, the following scenario would NOT be acceptable: If a fellow student is struggling with a question, you may not _send them your code so that that they can answer the question._ You may work with them to achieve code that works, but you cannot give them your code. We are learning to fish for ourselves, not to be given fish!

+ _**Extra credit comes with participating in the Slack, as follows:**_ There will be **0.25%** extra credit (as in, 0.25% towards your overall class grade) given for each week that you participate with at least one substantive post. This extra credit opportunity will ONLY be available for the first few weeks of class. When we transition to `#tidytuesday` extra credit, there will no longer be extra credit given for Slack participation.
  + Substantive posts would include:

    + Asking or answering a question on class material or homework
    + Asking or answering a question about using class tech, including RStudio Cloud, exercise websites, etc.
    + Asking or answering a question about finding the right resource for practicing or reading up on a given class topic 
    + *For the first week*, if you both post your own introduction before class on 1/27, and engage with someone else's introduction before the week ends on Sunday 1/31, you will get the first week's extra credit.
  + The following are great to see but do not count for extra credit:
    + Generic replies, e.g. "great" or "ok" without any direct evidence of engagement
    + Liking posts with emojis
    + Answering or asking logistical questions that are *clearly answered elsewhere* (when is the HW due? where is the course website? etc.)
  
  
 
    

## What you need to do for Wednesday January 27th

1. In the Canvas module "Everything you need," click the link "Link to JOIN the class Slack." This website will prompt you to join our class Slack. You can use either your Rowan or your personal email to join, but please make sure your displayed name *is your full preferred name!* 
2. After you have joined, you can access the Slack going forward at this link: [https://datascibio-s21.slack.com/](https://datascibio-s21.slack.com/). **I strongly recommend downloading Slack** - you can do so from [slack.com](https://slack.com/downloads) and/or from your phone's app store. If you download Slack, you can set up notifications to more easily participate.

3. Make your first post in the **`#introductions`** channel! In your post, tell us your year, major, a fun fact or two, and why you wanted to take this class. Protip: By sharing some fun facts about yourself, you can find others in the class with common interests, and you can make study groups (potentially for in-class breakouts as well!). Feel free to DM your new friends in the Slack, too! 

4. In the coming days, like each others' posts! Emojis, fun replies, gifs (keep it at most PG-13!) are welcome and encouraged!! I'll be there too!!
