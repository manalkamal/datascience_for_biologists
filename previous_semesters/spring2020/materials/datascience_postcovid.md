# Updated Information for `Data Science for Biologists (Spring 2020)`

## \textcolor{red}{READ THE CONTENTS OF THIS DOCUMENT CAREFULLY. Please post questions or clarifications in the \#logistical-questions Slack channel.}


**If you have not yet joined the class Slack workspace, please do so ASAP:**

+ [Link to join class workspace](https://join.slack.com/t/datasci-4-biologists/shared_invite/zt-cja6k48h-Eo2vQjroUrT5sah2i7Di2A)
+ Please download the Slack app for your computer and phone - will be very helpful and is WAY better than the browser version.


## Weekly class

+ Every week, you can expect 1-2 lecture videos to debut **each Monday** with that week's materials. Each week's (except the last week, keep reading!) assignment will be due the following **Sundays at 11:59 pm** (more info in next section). 
+ As before, materials will be hosted on the class website [here](https://spielmanlab.github.io/courses/datascience_for_biologists/), and submissions will be on Blackboard. 
+ **Please keep all active Projects in the CLASS RSTUDIO CLOUD WORKSPACE to ensure I can help you!!** Similarly, any other code you want me to see should go there. As usual, move the completed projects


## Updated Grading Scheme

Your final grade will now be determined from:

+ Midterm Project (25%)
+ Assignments (75%)

#### Details on assignments
+ You will stop drop the lowest grade!!
+ The Final Project will be converted to a _double assignment_ (i.e. will count as TWO assignment grades - total ~14% contribution to final grade rather than 25%).
+ In the end, there will be **11** assignments total that count towards your grade (remember one is dropped!). This means each assignment now counts as ~6.8% of your final grade:
	+ **6** assigned before break:
		+ Evaluating dataviz assignment (where we found bad figures, remember that?) 
		+ Intro `ggplot2`
		+ More `ggplot2`
		+ Wrangling with `dplyr`
		+ More wrangling with `dplyr`
		+ The never-ending `tidyr` assignemnt
	+ **6** coming up after break (tentative topics):
		+ Permutation testing assignment
		+ Linear modeling assignment
		+ Logistic regression assignment
		+ Clustering/PCA assignment
		+ Final assignment which counts DOUBLE
+ *Please rest assured: All forthcoming assignments really will be MUCH SHORTER and based around accomplishing only 1-2 overarching tasks.*   


+ You may participate in `#TidyTuesday` through the bitter end aka up until grades are due to the university on Friday 5/15/20. (Note, originally this would have ended during the last week of class, 4/28/20, so you get two more chances).

	+ Including *this week* (the dataset for 3/17/20), there are **NINE more** #TidyTuesday's you can do. 
	
	+ The last week considered will be for the dataset released on 5/12/20 *but ONLY IF you get it to me by 11:59 pm on Thursday 5/14* - this is necessary for the university grade entry deadline.
	
	

## Communication


### Virtual Meetings

> Please see that other document for Google Calendar Instructions

+ There will be two kinds of office hours, for which all scheduling will be done via **Google Calendar**. Join the calendar [here](https://calendar.google.com/calendar?cid=c3R1ZGVudHMucm93YW4uZWR1X3VwdTZ2Y3BqOWc4bTlra3ZkczhjaGE2bHNrQGdyb3VwLmNhbGVuZGFyLmdvb2dsZS5jb20) (you must be logged into your Rowan account). Please use the GOOGLE CHROME BROWSER!! Not Internet Explorer, not Safari, not Firefox - they are not guaranteed to work cleanly with the Google services that we will use.  Each meeting will either take place via Google Hangouts (likely for small one-on-one meetings), and larger class meetings will take place via Zoom.	

    + Every **Thursday from 12-1:45 pm** (during normal classtime) there will be an open session for anyone to join. Links to join these meetings will be embedded in the calendar event.
	+ Every **Tuesday 3-4:30 pm** and **Friday 3-4:30 pm** there will be opportunities to book individual (or team!!!) remote meetings with me, again via the class google calendar. These bi-weekly events are scheduled in the calendar. To make an appointment, click the event, and then click "Go to appointment page for this calendar." You can then book 1 or more (but please don't overbook!!) 15-minute time slots. Once you have made an appointment and I am notified, I will be able to turn on a link for the meeting. Make sure to book meetings in a timely fashion!!
	+ If you are unable to make any of those times, please DM me on Slack and we will find another suitable time to meet.
	+ To facilitate scheduling, I highly recommend you install the "Google Calendar" app to your Slack. See [here](https://slack.com/apps/ADZ494LHY-google-calendar?next_id=0) for information.
	+ **When coming to your personal meetings, please start initiating the process to join the meeting a few minutes early. It may take some time to set up. Don't take away from the next person's meeting time.**


##### For other types of communication (questions, emails), please default to the Slack Workspace for all communications:

+ DM me on the app for indiviualized conversation. If any conversation appears important enough to merit being on email, I will transition the conversation accordingly.
+ Use the `#channels` to direct flow of information and general discussions 
+ Protip! For each message you send to a `#channel`, there is an option to reply directly and start a thread - this keeps conversations grouped! If/when you start a thread, please be sure to click the button that shares responses with everyone in the class.


## What should you NOT worry about?

+ Attendance. There are no required in-person meeting times. As long as you get the work in on time, you'll be set.
+ Time to complete assignments. While there are deadlines, nothing will be within the context of a _timed_ Blackboard test. In other words, nothing will be a "do this in Blackboard and you get cut off in 45 minutes."
+ If you get severely ill and are unable to complete assignments, please reach out to me ASAP. I may ask for a _brief_ video chat to confirm your circumstances. **Extensions will be liberally granted when they are appropriate.** Please do not assume an extension is granted unless I explicitly tell you so - asking for one is not the same as receiving one.
	+ If an extension is not feasible given the circumstances, there will be a possibility to exempt you from the given assignment entirely.
