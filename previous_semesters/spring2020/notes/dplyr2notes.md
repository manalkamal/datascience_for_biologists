MOMv3.3.txt is really good for:
- https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1890/02-9003
- https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1890/02-9002
- recoding NA (they are -999)
- reference is a string, and it's absolutely vile. commas all around, some periods instead of commas, etc.
    + they'd have to design a regex to match it and then separate_rows with tidyr eeeeeeekkkkkk

there should be a MINIMUM of 1 commit per question (@ completion)

they have to join mammalian life history and and MOMv3.3. 
for this there needs to be a variable in common but one does not necessarily exist. 
they'll have to create one that does
then they have can join them together(!!!)
then resplit apart to make it tidy again

then there are lots of NAs but they are coded differently in each data set. 
students will have to recode NAs replace_na and/or na_if and then remove them potentially

Once combined answer some questions about the data. these questions will require you to either wrangle, manipulate, tidy or untidy, visualize the data. You'll have to see what you need!


## teach yourself two new packages: ggrepel, and flipbook

give them some dataset to make a scatterplot of where they use ggrepel, making use of one of its functions label or text.


Last question on project should be to make a beautiful visualization of their choosing using flipbook
https://resources.rstudio.com/rstudio-conf-2020/flipbooks-evangeline-reynolds
the rules:
it should answer a scientific question about the dataset, something you are truly interested in knowing. 
it can either be a dataset we have previous used in class, or a dataset you identify and use. _if you use your own dataset you must submit it!!_
it does not have to be a fancy flipbook like she goes into at the end, but it needs to be a flipbook.
HINT: In order to use flipbookr you have to install it. Do NOT keep any install code in your submitted docs.
it does need to have at least TWO customized features such as background color, code styling, etc.
write 2-4 sentences on what your flipbook reveals! This should be a text annotation under the final figure? is it possible?

## Debugging
discuss geom_col vs geom_bar and explain how the difference is in the STAT.
geoms are sometimes stats.

namespace
scope, interpretter: https://bookdown.org/rdpeng/rprogdatascience/scoping-rules-of-r.html
hardcoding         : 
meaningful variable names :
should we speak about reproducible research?
watch jenny bryan's video about debugging, it;s about an hour. you have notes.


=======================================================


we need to count the number again using BOTH group_by/tally and count
## Working with missing data
replace_na()
na_if()
drop_na()

## Working with conditional mutation
if_else() ## MUST BE SAME TYPE
case_when()

## Working with more than one tibble
left_join/right_join
inner_join
anti_join
bind_cols()
bind_rows()

======================================================

(use planets.csv)

## Working with strings in stringr
paste/paste0
str_to_upper()
str_to_lower()
str_to_title()
str_sort()
str_pad()
str_split()
str_detect() # returns T/F
str_count()
str_replace()
str_extract() # extract FIRST found - ALL TEXT
str_match() # regex version with group() and returns a motherfucking matrix?!
