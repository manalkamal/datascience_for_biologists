## Instructions

For your assignment, you will be honing your `dplyr` and `ggplot2` skills using a previous Tidy Tuesday dataset about meteorites. The dataset is described and documented [here](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2019/2019-06-11).

Please read these additional instructions carefully:

+ CODE MUST BE PRESENT FOR READING FILES AND SAVING PLOTS. NO CREDIT WILL BE GIVEN FOR ANY PLOT WHERE YOU DO NOT HAVE ASSOCIATED CODE TO PERFORM ALL TASKS.
  + NEVER CLICK THE "IMPORT DATASET" BUTTON. YOU MUST USE `read_csv()`.
  + NEVER CLICK THE "EXPORT" BUTTON IN THE "Plots" PANE. YOU MUST USE `ggsave()`.
+ All plots must be professionally labeled with clean X and Y axes. You are not required to include a title, subtitle, or caption, but you may include one or more of these labels if you choose.
+ All plots using aesthetic color/fill mappings _MUST USE_ a non-default color scale. Similarly, all legend titles must be professionally re-named from their default.
+ All plots must be clearly legible with an appropriate aspect ratio. This means you may need to change the output plot size using arguments `width` and `height` when calling `ggsave()`. *Make extra sure to LOOK AT YOUR SAVED PLOTS* and tweak the size until it looks clearly professional.
  + You may also need to modify certain theme components to achieve a professional look!
+ Ask me for help AT LEAST 24 hours before the deadline. I cannot guarantee time to help you if only short notice is given. Given my schedule, I can probably (unfortunately) guarantee that I won't have time to help.
+ Write all code yourself and include COMMENTS for each plot you create.
+ Please *comment out* (add `#` in front of) code that causes errors or bugs. This will ensure that your code runs without errors, while also showing me your code attempt if you only got part-way through recreating the plot.
