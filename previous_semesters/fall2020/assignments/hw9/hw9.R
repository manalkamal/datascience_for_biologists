## Who are you -----------------------------------------------------------------

## Your name: 



## Load libraries ------------------------------------------------------
library(tidyverse) 

## Code to read in the dataset --------------------------------------------


## Part 0 -----------------------------------------------------------------


## Part 1 -----------------------------------------------------------------

### Check and interpret linearity assumption



### Build model


### Check residuals normal assumption


### Interpret:

# Interpret the intercept on the next line(s) as comments:
# REPLACE THIS COMMENT WITH INTERCEPT INTERPRETATION

# Interpret the slope (balance coefficient) on the next line(s) as comments:
# REPLACE THIS COMMENT WITH SLOPE INTERPRETATION

# Interpret the R^2 value on the next line(s) as comments, and conclude whether balance is a weak/moderate/strong predictor of aroma.
# REPLACE THIS COMMENT WITH R^2 INTERPRETATION


### Visualize model result and save to file `part1.png` (you do NOT need to submit the png file!!)


## Part 2 -----------------------------------------------------------------

### Subset data to the question scope 



### Check and interpret equal variance assumption



### Build model


### Check residuals normal assumption


### Interpret:

# Interpret the intercept on the next line(s) as comments:
# REPLACE THIS COMMENT WITH INTERCEPT INTERPRETATION

# Interpret all country coefficients on the next line(s) as comments:
# REPLACE THIS COMMENT WITH INTERPRETATIONS OF COEFFICIENTS:

# Interpret the R^2 value on the next line(s) as comments, and conclude whether country is a weak/moderate/strong predictor of aroma.
# REPLACE THIS COMMENT WITH R^2 INTERPRETATION:



### Visualize model result and save to file `part2.png` (you do NOT need to submit the png file!!)


## Part 3 -----------------------------------------------------------------

### Build BOTH models


### Check residuals normal assumption for BOTH models



### Interpret:

# Which model is preferred: model with or without interaction? Clearly explain below.
# Hint: If an interaction effect is significant, it is the preferred model. If the interaction effects are NOT significant, we prefer the independent-effects model
# REPLACE THIS COMMENT WITH YOUR CONCLUSION FOR WHICH MODEL IS PREFERRED

# Considering the PREFERRED model, Interpret the R^2 value on the next line(s) as comments. Is this model a weak/moderate/strong predictor of aroma?
# REPLACE THIS COMMENT WITH R^2 INTERPRETATION:



### Visualize model result and save to file `part3.png` (you do NOT need to submit the png file!!)
