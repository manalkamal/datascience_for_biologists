## Provide your code AND associated comments in the space below each question.
## Do NOT delete the questions! Please keep formatting as is. 
## All figures you make MUST BE saved to a variable and printed using the `print()` function. The thing to print is the saved plot VARIABLE itself!
## This document must run with "Source" without errors or bugs for full credit. A 20% deduction is automatically applied to code with errors.

## FULL INSTRUCTIONS ARE ON THE CLASS WEBSITE
